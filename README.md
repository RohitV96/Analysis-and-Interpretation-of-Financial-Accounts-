In this project, we took a company called C&C Group plc that listed on the London Stock Exchange's main market and is therefore required to produce an annual report each year, included in which are the Annual Financial statements, and we are required to produce a report that analyzes the financial performance of our company over a four-year period.All of the Annual Reports contain at least two years worth of financial accounts, so by combining the data in the two sets of accounts, ,we will be able to analyze a total of four years, including appropriate visualizations of the financial data.
